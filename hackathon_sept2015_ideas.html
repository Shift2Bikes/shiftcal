<title>Shift Calendar Hackathon Sep 2015</title>

<h1>Most-voted-for features by survey respondents.</h1>
<ol>
<li>Allow export of shift calendar event information to google calendar automatically (<b><i>estimated medium-low effort</i></b>)
	<ul>
	<li>MVP design suggestions:
		<ul>
		<li>provide an .ics export of events that can be "added" to gcal and other ical-compatible services.
		<li>be certain that event ID's are unique but consistent so double-import won't show double events
		</ul>
	<li>For reference on how this is already done, check out a pedalpalooza ical export:  <a href=https://github.com/ShiftGithub/shiftcal/blob/master/icalpp.php>icalpp.php on github</a>
	</ul>
<li>Allow people to comment on listed rides (<b><i>estimated effort: low</i></b>)
	<ul>
	<li>This is already possible - see the 'forum' link on every event.
	<li>Suggestions for enhancement:
		<ul>
		<li>Could highlight events with comments in other views and make the link to the forum more obvious
		<li>Could add forum link to event info upon ical export
		<li>Could add facebook event link to event info with a checkbox to encourage discussion there.
		</ul>
	</ul>
<li>Mobile-friendly site (<b><i>estimated effort: medium/large</i></b>)
	<ul>
	<li>there is a mobile-friendly-ish view already available for the pedalpalooza calendar that could be good to work from for a quick migration:  <a href=https://github.com/ShiftGithub/shiftcal/blob/master/mobilepp.php>mobilepp.php on github</a>
	<li>suggestions for enhancement:  <a href=mailto:ohwang00@gmail.com>One</a> has made up some wireframes with a rebooted look and feel which will definitely be more familiar and friendly for mobile users.  
	<li>suggestions for implementation:  
		<ul><li>implement the functionality in separate files from existing site so it can be dropped in separately (and maybe index.php can do some User-Agent checking to forward?).  We can request new hostnames be setup (eg m.shift2bikes.org) but they may not be able to be implemented during the hackathon.
		<li><a href=https://github.com/kirkendall>Steve</a> wrote up some of the work he did 4 years ago in this <a href=https://github.com/ShiftGithub/shiftcal/blob/master/mobile>file on github</a>
		</ul>
	</ul>
<li>newsfeeds or alerts of new rides/activities (<b><i>estimated effort: medium/small</i></b>)
	<ul><li>there is a very limited existing RSS functionality that could be improved, see *rss* on github.
	<li>not sure what other alerts make sense besides calendar integration, but will be curious to see what comes up
	</ul>
<li>See who has RSVPed for the ride. (<b><i>estimated effort: unknown</i></b>)
	<ul><li>since there is no RSVP system in place, the sky is the limit here.  It could be as easy as showing a number via API call from facebook in case someone implements a minimal version of the "add facebook link (optional) to event info", though this excludes non-facebook events/users.  Note that we would like to keep the calendar site completely usable without logins (either on the calendar site, or on facebook).
	</ul>
<li>Export information that I enter on Shift into Facebook Events automatically (<b><i>estimated effort: unknown</i></b>)
	<ul><li>MVP suggestion:  add a new field to event creation (don't forget to update the short, long, and pedalpalooza versions) inviting user to add a link to their facebook event.  To put frosting on the cupcake, poll facebook via API to see # of rsvp's and display that information with the event info
	<li>alternate more-effort suggestion:  work with <a href=mailto:gently@gmail.com>Chris/fool</a> to get new events syncing to and from the 'shift' or 'pedalpalooza' groups on FB (he has admin access to both).  Would have to ensure no duplicates were created in either place so may be best to constrain the sync to unidirectional?
	</ul>
<li>Route / Ride description improvements (<b><i>estimated effort:  small to medium</i></b>).  Several ideas were offered, all listed below in voted order:
	<ul><li>ability to more specifically specify theme and focus (presumably in a separate field from description, where you could already put it?)
	<li>ability for ride organizer to list length of the ride/end location (already available in description - do we need a special field to list this?)
	<li>ability to list "friends also attending" - I guess via facebook API?  Not sure what the dream might be here.
	<li>highlight who is leading and organizing the ride (there is already a field for this, not sure what improvements make sense here)
	</ul>
<li>update site to "modern" javascript library like bootstrap.io or jquery (<b><i>estimated effort: high</i></b>).  Talk to Steve or Chris before starting down this road.  Total replacement might be a challenge, so partial solutions that don't break existing functionality without offering replacement.
<li>update site to a more calagator-like view. (<b><i>estimated effort: varies</i></b>)
	<ul><li>MVP suggestion:  if showing multiweek view, don't show days in the past particularly in the event listings below calendar view
	<li>could make a view that is calendar-free (all events, like <a href=http://calagator.org>calagator</a>
	<li>various views already exist, so make sure to cheat off them or extend them rather than reinventing the wheel :)
	<li>thought: perhaps preferred setting - no-week view, 1-week view, multi-week view, could be saved as a cookie so set per user without logins?
	</ul>
</ol>
