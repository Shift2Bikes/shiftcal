    <h1>Code</h1>
    This document describes the directories and source code files of the
    Shift calendar.
    <p>
    The calendar is written in a mixture of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and
    SQL, often all mixed together in the same file.  Such is the state of
    web design.
    <dl>
      <dt>eventimages/
      <dd>This is where the event images are stored.  The filenames are
	  always the event ID number, with the extension indicating the
	  image file format.  For example, "114.jpg" would be a JPEG image
	  for the event that has calevent.id=114.

      <dt>explain/
      <dd>All of the form's little help files go here.  They are mostly small
	  HTML files describing one or two fields, and they all have a little
	  JavaScript in them to close them when clicked anywhere.

      <dt>explain/repeathelp.php
      <dd>This describes the date parser in detail.  It also contains a
	  little form where users can experiment with the date parser.

      <dt>images/
      <dd>These are other images used by the calendar -- backgrounds,
	  icons, buttons, the poster image.  Everything except event
	  images.

      <dt>include/
      <dd>This mostly contains PHP files that don't generate complete
	  web pages.  There are also a few JavaScript files here.  All are
	  meant to be included in a PHP or HTML file in the calendar's main
	  directory.

      <dt>include/account.php
      <dd>This defines the constants needed for accessing the MySQL database,
	  plus a couple of other site-specific constants.  This file is
	  included in include/common.php, so usually you'll just want to
	  include include/common.php in your PHP pages.  You won't explicitly
	  mention include/account.php in your PHP pages at all.

	  I actually have two versions: include/account.php-canvasdreams which
	  has database account info for Canvas Dreams (the ISP which hosts
	  Shift's website), and include/account.php-sampo which has account
	  info for my own Linux system, where I do testing.  Currently,
	  include/account.php-sampo is copied to include/account.php so
	  sampo's account info is used.

      <dt>include/common.php
      <dd>This should be included in any PHP file in the main directory.
	  It includes include/account.php to define the database access
	  constants, and then goes on to define some configuration constants
	  and functions that are handy throughout the calendar code.  For
	  example, the PHP functions for obscuring &amp; unobscuring event IDs
	  reside here.

      <dt>include/countdown.js
      <dd>JavaScript code for inserting a countdown timer into a web page.
	  This is used to nag people about approaching deadlines.  For example,
	  this counts down until the end of the Mayan "long cycle" calendar:
	  <pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="include/countdown.js"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
...
According to Mayan lore, the world will end in
&lt;span style='color:#800000;font-size:larger;white-space:nowrap'&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    countdown(\"Sat Dev 22 2012 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (EST)\");
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
(and a new world, the fourth, will begin).
          </pre>

      <dt>include/repeat.php
      <dd>This is the main date parser.  It defines a PHP function named
	  repeatdates() which converts a text string such as "first wednesday
	  of each month" into an array of records describing the actual dates.
	  The file also defines some low-level functions which are sometimes
	  useful when debugging.

      <dt>include/repeatdebug.php
      <dd>This contains some functions for converting the date parser's
	  internal data structures into human-readable strings.

      <dt>include/util.js
      <dd>This includes some generally useful JavaScript functions.  At
	  present, it mostly contains fields for programmatically altering
	  the contents of a &lt;textarea&gt; input without moving the cursor.

      <dt>include/<?php echo CALURL;?>js/xmlextras.js
      <dd>This mostly contains a wrapper to hide browser-specific quirks
	  of XmlHttp.

      <dt>pix/
      <dd>This is where I play with images, especially icons.  I generally
	  start with a simple *.xbm image, and then convert it to a GIF file
	  (using the "gifinate" script) before moving it to images/


      <dt>admclobber.php
      <dd>This sets up the SQL tables required by the calendar.  You must be
	  logged into the calendar's admin.php page for this to work!  If you
	  ever need to add a column to one of the tables, do it here.

      <dt>admforum.php
      <dd>This lists recent messages added to any event forums, and delete
	  inappropriate ones.  The forum code does try to prevent spamming,
	  but that can't be 100% perfect.

      <dt>admin.php
      <dd>This is the login page and main menu for the administrator functions.

      <dt>admnodate.php
      <dd>This lists any events which have no dates (i.e., an calevent
	  records which have no corresponding caldaily records).  This should
	  never happen, but on rare occasions it does.

      <dt>admreview.php
      <dd>This lets you edit Pedalpalooza events BEFORE THE SUBMISSION DEADLINE.
	  You can edit titles and messages, send email to the event organizer,
	  and flag events to be omitted or included.  As event organizers make
	  changes to the calendar, you can easily see changed events and
	  re-review them.  This way, you don't need to do all event prep between
	  the submission deadline and the printer's deadline.
	  
      <dt>admvenue.php
      <dd>This lists all known venues.  You can lock the good ones and delete
	  the bad ones.  Its slow and clunky though.

      <dt>calform.php
      <dd>This is the BIG SCARY EVENT SUBMISSION FORM.  Compared to this,
	  everything else is trivial.  I really need to find a way to split
	  this into multiple files.

      <dt>calforum.php
      <dd>This displays the forum for a single event, and a form for
	  submitting new messages.  When you click that form's [Submit]
	  button, it also sends a ppforum.php message only this time it'll
	  have extra parameters containing your message.  The message
	  parameters are processed (and the message is added to the forum
	  database tablez) before the response is generated, so you'll see
	  your new message immediately.

      <dt>calsubmit.php
      <dd>When you click ppform.php's [Submit] button, the event details are
	  sent to this script.  It updates the database, and also tries to
	  list the exact changes on the screen, and in an email message that
	  it sends to the event organizer.

      <dt>countpp.php
      <dd>This counts the number of events on the Pedalpalooza calendar,
	  for each date leading up to the start of Pedalpalooza.  It is
	  intended to allow you see trends, so if you have just 50 events
	  one month before the event you'll know whether its time to panic
	  or not.  If you want to use this, you should fetch countpp.php
	  at least once per day, preferably near the end of the day.

      <dt>icalpp.php
      <dd>Returns an iCal document describing the events scheduled for
	  Pedalpalooza (or whatever the festival is called).  You can
	  configure Google Calendar to read this directly, after which it
	  will automatically maintain its own up-to-date copy of the events.

      <dt>mobilepp.php
      <dd>This is an interactive view of the festival calendar, intended for
	  use on mobile devices (cell phones, smart phones, and tablets).
	  It tries to minimize the amount of data sent, and it doesn't depend
	  on a pointing device or touch screen.

      <dt>vfyaddress.php
      <dd>This is a simple behind-the-scenes request for verifying addresses.
	  The ppform.php file's JavaScript code uses XmlHttp to send the
	  address to ppverify.php, which then turns around and sends the
	  address to tripplanner.bycycle.org... or at least it used to, until
	  tripplanner.bycycle.org died.  I've been meaning to convert it to
	  use Google Maps for validation, but haven't gotten around to it yet.
          <p>
	  (vfyaddress.php's JavaScript doesn't send the address directly to
	  tripplanner.bycycle.org because JavaScript's security won't allow
	  any messages to be sent to hosts other than the one that supplied
	  the JavaScript code -- namely, shift2bikes.org.)

      <dt>vfydates.php
      <dd>This is a simple behind-the-scenes request for parsing date strings,
	  and checking the status for all of a given event's dates.

      <dt>view3week.php
      <dd>This returns a rolling 3-week view of the calendar.

      <dt>viewbackup.php
      <dd>This outputs the event data for current &amp; future events, in a
	  simple XML format.  At present, there is no tool to actually
	  restore the backup though.

      <dt>viewbulletin.php
      <dd>This outputs an approximation of Shift's printed bulletin.  We used
	  to hand these out during Breakfast on the Bridges each month, but
	  we've fallen out of the habit, mostly because nobody wants to
	  volunteer to do the final editing and printing.

      <dt>viewcsv.php
      <br>viewtab.php
      <br>viewhtml.php
      <dd>These output the Pedalpalooza events in various formats.
	  viewcsv.php outputs the values in "comma separated values" format and
	  viewtab.php outputs them in "tab separated values" format, either
	  of which should be easy to import into a database or spreadsheet.
	  viewhtml.php outputs them in a simple HTML format which (it is hoped)
	  can be cut &amp; pasted into a desktop publisher.

      <dt>viewday.php
      <dd>This outputs a FRAGMENT of a page, containing a single day's events.
	  This is because viewpp2012.php doesn't show the details of all days'
	  events, because there are so many!  In an effort to reduce our
	  bandwidth in June, the viewpp2012.php page omits most of the details.
	  When you click on a date, it uses viewday.php to retrieve that day's
	  event details.

      <dt>viewmonth.php
      <dd>This shows a whole calendar month of events.

      <dt>viewmypdfpp.php
      <dd>This generates a PDF document containing only the events you selected
	  in the viewmypp.php page.

      <dt>viewmypp.php
      <dd>This is an interactive page.  It lists all events that occur during
	  Pedalpalooza, with a checkbox next to each one allowing you to add
	  it to "your" list.  The list is stored in a cookie on your computer;
	  checking an event does not in any way consititute an RSVP to an
	  event.  Mostly, it lets you select events and options for generating
	  your own customer pocket reference.

      <dt>viewpp2012.php
      <dd>This is the Pedalpalooza 2012 view of the calendar.  It shows only
	  the dates of Pedaplalooza.  Superficially it resembles the rolling
	  3-week view in view3week.php, but viewpp2012 is more limited...
	  except that at the top it also shows the Pedalpalooza poster image,
	  a submission countdown, and a few other links and buttons.
	  <p>
	  Each year, I create a new version of viewpp????.php, using the
	  colors of the poster.  After Pedalpalooza, I replace the database-
	  driven version with one that has hardcoded events, so that nobody
	  can go back and edit history.

      <dt>viewrss.php
      <br>viewrssrecent.php
      <br>viewrsstomorrow.php
      <br>viewrssweek.php
      <dd>These are RSS feeds... with mixed success.  viewrss.php works well
	  as a "live bookmark" in Firefox.  None of them, frankly, look really
	  good in an RSS viewer.

      <dt>viewsearch.php
      <dd>This has a simple form for searching.  When you enter search info,
	  it reloads the page with the search results appended at the bottom.

      <dt>viewsingle.php
      <dd>This returns a FRAGMENT of a page containing the details of a single
	  event.  In the viewmypp.php page, if you hover over an event's
	  checkbox, it'll show the event's details in a pop-up window.  The
	  viewsingle.php request is used to fetch that event's decription.

      <dt>viewtoday.php
      <dd>This returns a FRAGMENT of HTML code containing a "today and tomorrow"
	  view of the calendar.  The idea is that you can embed this in your
	  site's front page, giving people an easy view of the basics.  The
	  code to embed it is pretty simple...
	  <pre>
	  &lt;?php include('cal/viewtoday.php'); ?&gt;
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	  This example assumes you put the calendar code in a subdirectory
	  named "cal", under the main directory for your site.  You may also
	  want to wrap it in a &lt;div&gt; block so you can add an outline or
	  whatever.
