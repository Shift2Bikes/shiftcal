/ Add a hidden field to forum and event forms.  Not type="hidden", just a
  normal input that isn't displayed.  If it somehow acquires a value, then
  assume the form will filled by a spambot.

/ Deal with Microsoft's wacky punctuation.  Store it as non-wacky ASCII.

/ In calform.php, the text above the long description textarea needs to
  end with a <br> tag.  The way it is now, the word "free" can get shoved
  into the corner where nobody will notice it.

/ In calfornm.php, the description of the address should say that it's
  okay to say "TBA" if you have chosen a location yet.  You can come back
  to edit it later with the real location.

/ Bug: On the Pedalpalooza calendar, each instance of an event is counted.
  It should count each repeating event *once* no matter how often it repeats.

  Minor stuff: The UFO link could be better.

/ Bug: If a highlighted event is edited, it looses its highlight.

* Modify calform.php so that if you submit a change to a repeating event,
  it asks whether the change is intended to be repeated, or a new exception.
  (The exception date should be either the next instance of the date, or
  possibly during Pedalpalooza.)  So instead of the usual confirm() dialog,
  I'll have to use CSS to make a pop-up window with 3 or 4 buttons.

	This is a repeating event.  Do you intend to make these
	changes apply to every future instance of this event,
	or just once?

	[All events] [Feb 10 only] [Pedalpalooza only] [Edit/Cancel]

  In addition, I'll have to modify calsubmit to handle an extra parameter
  to indicate when a change is supposed to create an exception and modify
  that exception.  This is a little tricky because the new date might not
  be the same as the generic event's date.  Another complication is that
  an event might repeat multiple times during Pedalpalooza, which should
  cause it to create an exception for each of those days.

  In calform.php:
	When [Submit] is clicked and we're modifying an event (not adding
	a new one), reparse the date string.  If it is scattered, then
	pop the question.  [All events] sets action="Update".  The first
	date returned by parsing the date string is used as the second
	button's label (canonical) and value (sqldate).  If any events
	occur during pedalpalooza and are not just the first date, then
	create a [Pedalpalooza only] button which sets action=PPNAME.

	Then it must show the dialog... or maybe instead, just replace
	the [Submit] button with the above buttons?

	Okay, another complication: If the "dates" field is changed,
	then forget all this and just use the plain old [Submit].

  In calsubmit.php:
	Enhance support for the "action" parameter.
	value will be either "Add", "Delete", "Update", PPNAME, or a
	date string.  The first three values are already implemented.
	If PPNAME then find the dates of the original repeating event
	that occur between PPSTART and PPEND and make them be exceptions
	(if they aren't already), and apply all modifications specified
	via other parameters to those exceptions.  If a date is given,
	use it as both the start and end dates, instead of PPSTART and
	PPEND (may need to canonicalize it).  NOTE: The PPSTART and date
	changes mostly boil down to changing the WHERE clause in the
	"Update" logic's SQL statement.

* Add the "Ride Leader Comic" to the form. (Done!)

* Deal with accented characters.  How to store?  How to encode in a page?

* Support using Google Maps, Trimet OpenTripPlanner Map, or opencyclemap.org
  / Is bycycle.org dead?  YES!  It will be missed.
  * Add an option to select the map to use.
  * Trimet Open Trip Planner: rtp.trimet.org
    * Pretty complete and a good trip planner.  Multimodal, elevation graph.
    * rtpfeedback@trimet.org
  * Google Maps:
    * Verify addresses via their API, possibly including a region code?
      http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?sensor=false&address=...
      * Region code won't do it.  Our region code indicates the country,
	not an area within a state.
    / Show via google maps, using the exact same address passed to the API
      http://maps.google.com/q=...
  * OpenCycleMap.org
    * Spotty and inclomplete.  Also, the map shows all city names in the
      same size font, which is weird -- you really have to zoom in to see
      Portland, since Durham takes priority.
    * Worldwide, and an open project.
